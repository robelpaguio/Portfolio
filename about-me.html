<p>Hi, I'm <strong> Robel Paguio </strong>-- <strong>"Robes"</strong> for short.</p>

<p>
  I recently left my job as a Global Learning & Development manager for WeWork in March.
  Now I'm a full-time student pursuing both UX/UI design through Flatiron School and front-end
  development through UW.</p>
<p>
  I learned how to code my first website in high school and fell in love with web design in college.
  It was after college when I decided to pivot, focusing on business operation and people development.
  While I enjoyed helping both startups and individuals grow and find success, I still carried the itch
  to design, so I geared up for another pivot.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy cooking as a way to distress and staying active. I've danced all my life and love ripping up the dance
  floor at every friend's wedding. I'm also a huge Harry Potter nerd, but I haven't tested my knowledge
  at a trivia night yet!
